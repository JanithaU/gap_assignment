# Assignment Documentation 

Two apps created under autocompany project, car_part_sale and api
In car_part_sale, it has all the models needed for this assignment and under api we have the views, serializers and urls.






With docker-composer,
docker-compose up -d --build


Then,
$ docker-compose exec app python manage.py migrate


To Create a superuser,
$ docker-compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser




As a native or / Docker,


1. Set up the DB configuration.
2. Apply the necessary commands makemigrations, migrate
3. Create a superuser
4. Login to admin panel to see the table structure and create the necessary data or, use following API calls,
* http://localhost:8000/api-auth/login/
Login to api via the browser , or via the flowing post call generate a valid token


OR
Via postman

[POST] http://localhost:8000/api/token/

{
    "username": "<Created Username>",
    "password": "<Created Password>"
}


Above call will return a token,


Once you have the bearer token , use it to call other API calls.






5. If you need more users, you can add via the API,
* [POST] http://localhost:8000/api/users/register  


{

      "password2" : "123"




    }




6. You can list down users,     ### added this to just to check against multiple users.

    "slug": "wheel",
    "name": "wheel, Tyre",
    "description": "Before we get into the types of wheels, you should familiarize yourself with the various components of the wheel, which include three main parts: the tire, the rim, and the hub. The tire, which is the width of the wheel, goes around the rim and gives the wheel grip on the road surface."
}
